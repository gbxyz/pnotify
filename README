NAME
    pnotify - A simple, portable Perl script for sending DNS NOTIFY packets
    with TSIG support.

SYNOPSIS
    pnotfy [options]

    Options:

            --zone=ZONE             The DNS zone
            --class=CLASS           The class (default IN)
            --server=HOST           Host to send the packet to
            --port=PORT             Destination port to send the packet
                                    to (default 53)
            --timeout=TIMEOUT       Timeout in seconds (default 1)
            --tsig-name=NAME        Optional TSIG name
            --tsig-key=KEY          Optional TSIG KEY (only HMAC-MD5 is
                                    supported)
            --source=ADDR           Use this source address (optional)
            --help                  Show this help

OUTPUT
    pnotify will print either the rcode of the server response or "TIMEOUT"
    to STDOUT.

EXIT CODE
    For a successful transaction (rcode=NOERROR), the exit code will be 0.
    For all other outcomes it will be 1.

RATIONALE
    It is sometimes useful to be able to manually send a NOTIFY packet to a
    DNS server. There are other tools to do this (eg nsd-notify(8)) but they
    are not as portable as pnotify, which is a pure Perl script with only a
    limited range of prerequisites.
